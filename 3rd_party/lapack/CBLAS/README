INSTALLATION

   Make sure to set these variables appropriately in your Make.inc in the LAPACK folder:

      CBLASLIB is your CBLAS library
      BLASLIB  is your Legacy BLAS library (by default the Reference BLAS shipped within LAPACK)

   Then type:

      prompt> make

   which will create the CBLAS library.

CREATING THE TESTERS

    type:

      prompt> make cblas_testing

   This will create the BLAS library if necessary, then compile the CBLAS testings.

EXECUTING THE TESTERS

    type:

      prompt> make runtst

   This package contains C interface to Legacy BLAS.

   This release updates an inconsistency between the BLAST document and
   the interface. According to the document, the enumerated types for
   the C interface to the BLAS are not typedef'ed.

   It also updates the Level 2 and 3 testers which check for correct
   exiting of routines when called with bad arguments. This is done by
   overriding the Legacy BLAS library's implementation of xerbla().  If
   this cannot be done ( for instance one cannot override some calls
   to xerbla() in Sun's Performance library), then correct error
   exiting cannot be checked.

Fixed the i?amax error that I reported three years ago: standard dictates
IAMAX return vals in range 0 <= iamax < N, but reference was mistakenly
returning like F77: 0 < iamax <= N.
