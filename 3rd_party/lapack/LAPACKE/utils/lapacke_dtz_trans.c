/*****************************************************************************
  Converts input triangular matrix from row-major(C) to column-major(Fortran)
  layout or vice versa. The shape of the trapezoidal matrix is determined by
  the arguments `direct` and `uplo`. `Direct` chooses the diagonal which shall
  be considered and `uplo` tells us whether we use the upper or lower part of
  the matrix with respect to the chosen diagonal.

      Diagonals 'F' (front / forward) and 'B' (back / backward):

        A = ( F       )           A = ( F     B       )
            (    F    )               (    F     B    )
            ( B     F )               (       F     B )
            (    B    )
            (       B )

      direct = 'F', uplo = 'L':

        A = ( *       )           A = ( *             )
