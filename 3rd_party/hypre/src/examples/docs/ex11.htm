<p>
This example solves the 2-D Laplacian eigenvalue problem with zero boundary
conditions on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2. The standard
5-point stencil is used, and we solve for the interior nodes only.
<p>
We use the same matrix as in Examples 3 and 5.  The eigensolver is LOBPCG with
AMG preconditioner.
