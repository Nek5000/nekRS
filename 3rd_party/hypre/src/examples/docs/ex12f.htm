The grid layout is the same as ex1, but with nodal unknowns. The solver is PCG
preconditioned with either PFMG or BoomerAMG, set in the code.

We recommend viewing the Struct examples before viewing this and the other
SStruct examples.  This is one of the simplest SStruct examples, used primarily
to demonstrate how to set up non-cell-centered problems, and to demonstrate how
easy it is to switch between structured solvers (PFMG) and solvers designed for
more general settings (AMG).
