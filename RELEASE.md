# Release v22.0

## What is new? 

* Multi-session (uncoupled) support
* Support unaligned symmetry boundary condition
* Support (unaligned) traction boundary condition
* Better performance on AMD MI-GPUs
* FLOP counters
* Various bug fixes 

## Good to know

* OpenCL support is disabled by default 

## Breaking Changes

* [udf] Rename `udfBuildKernel` => `oudfBuildKernel`
* [par] Separate details of coarse grid discretization from coarse grid solver
        e.g., `coarseSolver = SEMFEM+AmgX` is replaced by
        `coarseSolver = AmgX` and `coarseGridDiscretization = SEMFEM`
* [par] Remove `preconditioner=semg` and `preconditioner=semg_amg`
* [udf] Rename plug-in name `avg`  => `tavg`
* [udf] Rename `nrs->converged` => `nrs->timeStepConverged`

## Known Bugs / Restrictions

* Mesh solver does not support CHT and unaligned sym/shl BCs
* [729](https://github.com/Nek5000/Nek5000/issues/729)
* [300](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/issues/300)
* [258](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/issues/258)

A special shout out to Tim Warburton at VT for tuning some critical kernels. 


# Release v21.1

## What is new? 

* Flexible GMRES
* Constant flow rate
* Time step controller for targetCFL
* Improved runtime statistics
* Support for ROCm version > v4.0
* AVM for scalars
* FEMSEM preconditioner
* Update file (nekrs.upd) for runtime modifications
* Validate key/value input in par
* Various bug fixes 

## Good to know 
* [par] `preconditioner = multigrid` was replaced by `preconditioner = multigrid+coarse`
* [par] Only valid `key/value` pairs will be accepted 
* [par] Default smootherType is `ASM+Chebyshev+degree=2` (instead of degree=1)
* [fld] Only first checkpoint will contain mesh coordinates 
* GMRES is now the default linear solver for pressure (higher memory usage)

## Breaking Changes 

* [udf] Use std namespace qualifier e.g. `std::cout` instead of `cout`
* [udf] Rename `UDF_LoadKernels(nrs_t *nrs)` => `UDF_LoadKernels(occa::properties& kernelInfo)`
* [udf] Replace argument `nrs_t *nrs` by `occa::properties& kernelInfo` in `udfBuildKernel()`, `(plugin)::buildKernel()`
* [udf] `UDF_LoadKernels(occa::properties& kernelInfo)` is no longer optional
* Code crashes (Segmentation fault: invalid permissions) if MPI installation is not GPU aware unless you specify `NEKRS_GPU_MPI=0` in `$NEKRS_HOME/nekrs.conf`

## Known Bugs / Restrictions

* [383](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/issues/383)
* [300](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/issues/300)
* [258](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/issues/258)
* [201](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/issues/201)
