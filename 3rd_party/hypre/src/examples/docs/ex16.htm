This code solves the 2D Laplace equation using a high order Q3 finite element
discretization.  Specifically, we solve -Delta u = 1 with zero boundary
conditions on a unit square domain meshed with a uniform grid.  The mesh is
distributed across an N x N process grid, with each processor containing an n x
n sub-mesh of data, so the global mesh is nN x nN.
